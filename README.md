# Portfolio

#### This is the portfolio of Osman Muglu. It contains several projects related to data engineering, programming and data analysis. For full functionality using jupyter notebook is recommended.

#### All projects within this portfolio are done using Python. The most commonly used tools are Pandas, Folium, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 

### Programming and Data analysis:

<b>Project 1 - NYC Borouhgs And Neighborhoods:</b> Within this project, we have analyzed data in order to find the safest borough in New York City. Venue data was also analyzed to find out which neighbordhood is best to move to. (This project contain 2 extra files; a report and a presentation)

<b>Project 2 - Scaling Up Healthcare Capacity Netherlands:</b> The Netherland has one of the lowest hospital capacities in the world. To deal with the next virus outbreak the Dutch government definitely needs to scale up its capacity. We have analyzed hospital and pharmacy data from all Dutch provinces. In this project, data is analyzed from each Dutch province. The knowledge gained from this is used to determine where additional hospitals and pharmacies should be opened. (This project contains one extra file; a report)

<i>In the projects 3 to 8, we will deal only with exploratory analysis, where the objective is to understand how the data is distributed and generate insight for future decision-making, this analysis aims to explore as much as possible the data in a simple, intuitive and informative way.</i> 

<b>Project 3 - Videogame Sales Analysis 1980 - 2015:</b> The data analyzed in this project contain information about video game sales between 1980 and 2015. This notebook shows results, gained from exploratory data analysis, about Games, Genres, and Publishers. 

<b>Project 4 - Kaggle Titanic Data Analysis:</b> In this project, we analyzed the data containing information about the Titanic survivors. First, we explore the data and take a look at the distribution of the passenger.  Secondly, I have looked at whether certain indicators or variables had an influence on the survival rate of the passengers. 

<b>Project 5 - Twitch Data analysis:</b> For this project, we used a lot of datasets containing Twitch data. We gained new insight through exploratory data analyses. Also, in this project, we predict watch by using linear regression. 

<b>Project 6 - 911 Data Analysis:</b> In this project, we analyzed 911 (emergency calls) data from  Montgomery County Pennsylvania. We try to explore the dataset in order to gain deeper answers to some questions like: "What is the reason for the emergency?" and "When are people calling the emergency line the most?".

<b>Project 7 - Insurance:</b> The data analyzed in this project contains information about the cost of treatment of different patients. The cost of treatment depends on many factors: diagnosis, type of clinic, city of residence, age, and so on. We have information that can help us to make conclusions about the health of patients.

<b>Project 8 - Netflix:</b> For this project, we use two different datasets. One containing data about movies and TV shows on Netflix and the other about reviews of movies and TV shows. In the notebook can be seen that these data frames are merged together in order to complete the exploratory data analysis.
