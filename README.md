# Portfolio

#### This is the portfolio of Osman Muglu. It contains several projects related to data engineering, programming and data analysis. For full functionality using jupyter notebook is recommended.

#### All projects within this portfolio are done using Python. The most commonly used tools are Pandas, Folium, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 

#### Programming and data engineering:

<b>Project 1 - Data scraping, databases and Flask applications:</b>

<b>Project 1 - Flask App - Task Master:</b> In this project we built Task master applicaton using Flask for your daily to-do list. . Witin this project we used Python, SQLalchemy (database), HTML and CSS.  In this application you can add, update and delete items within your to-do list. The data that is used on the website goes through the database. 

<b>Project 2 - Wheather data:</b> Within this project we mine the wheather data of Google. For this a python code is wirtten in order to get elements from the wheather data on Google. 

<b>Project 3 - Lunch database and table:</b> Here we create a database and table. Also we fill this table with data. In this project we used python and Sqlite 3. 

<b>Project 4 - Price comparison:</b> In this project we scrape data from different websites and save in a database. In order compare the prices of the product we get the data from the database and analyse it. For this project python and Sqlite3 is used. 

<b>Project 5 - Random beer app:</b> Within this project a random beer generator app is build. In order to built it data has been scraped from a website. In this project we used python and HTML. 

<b>Project 2 - PySpark and SparkSQL:</b>

<b>Project 2.1 - Friends Data:</b> In this project a CSV data file is loaded and read using spark. The data is put into a dataframe in order to run an SQL query over it. 

<b>Project 2.2 - Data by age:</b> In this project a CSV data file is loaded and read using spark. here only spark functions are using in order to group, aggregate and sort the data. 

### Programming and Data analysis:

<b>Project 1 - NYC Borouhgs And Neighborhoods:</b> Within this project, we have analyzed data in order to find the safest borough in New York City. Venue data was also analyzed to find out which neighbordhood is best to move to. (This project contain 2 extra files; a report and a presentation)

<b>Project 2 - Scaling Up Healthcare Capacity Netherlands:</b> The Netherland has one of the lowest hospital capacities in the world. To deal with the next virus outbreak the Dutch government definitely needs to scale up its capacity. We have analyzed hospital and pharmacy data from all Dutch provinces. In this project, data is analyzed from each Dutch province. The knowledge gained from this is used to determine where additional hospitals and pharmacies should be opened. (This project contains one extra file; a report)

<i>In the projects 3 to 8, we will deal only with exploratory analysis, where the objective is to understand how the data is distributed and generate insight for future decision-making, this analysis aims to explore as much as possible the data in a simple, intuitive and informative way.</i> 

<b>Project 3 - Videogame Sales Analysis 1980 - 2015:</b> The data analyzed in this project contain information about video game sales between 1980 and 2015. This notebook shows results, gained from exploratory data analysis, about Games, Genres, and Publishers. 

<b>Project 4 - Kaggle Titanic Data Analysis:</b> In this project, we analyzed the data containing information about the Titanic survivors. First, we explore the data and take a look at the distribution of the passenger.  Secondly, I have looked at whether certain indicators or variables had an influence on the survival rate of the passengers. 

<b>Project 5 - Twitch Data analysis:</b> For this project, we used a lot of datasets containing Twitch data. We gained new insight through exploratory data analyses. Also, in this project, we predict watch by using linear regression. 

<b>Project 6 - 911 Data Analysis:</b> In this project, we analyzed 911 (emergency calls) data from  Montgomery County Pennsylvania. We try to explore the dataset in order to gain deeper answers to some questions like: "What is the reason for the emergency?" and "When are people calling the emergency line the most?".

<b>Project 7 - Insurance:</b> The data analyzed in this project contains information about the cost of treatment of different patients. The cost of treatment depends on many factors: diagnosis, type of clinic, city of residence, age, and so on. We have information that can help us to make conclusions about the health of patients.

<b>Project 8 - Netflix:</b> For this project, we use two different datasets. One containing data about movies and TV shows on Netflix and the other about reviews of movies and TV shows. In the notebook can be seen that these data frames are merged together in order to complete the exploratory data analysis.
